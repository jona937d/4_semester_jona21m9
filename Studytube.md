Today i spend time making the weekplan, i choose to make it in Github and will somehow integrate it in Powerpages this friday. I researched for different Linkedin certificates, that is relevant for this semester. I ended up finding one callled "Career Essentials in Software Development by Microsoft and LinkedIn" (link in the Reference dropdown). The certificate consists of three different courses (see picture in the dropdown menu)

The course contained the basic idea of being a software developer, different roles, programming languages and also some hands-on coding examples. I ended the course by doing an exam, that i will show in the picture dropdown. There will also be code snippets of the exercises. I think the course was a little easy, but i still think it benefitted me and freshened up my coding skills.

<summary> Describtion</summary>
<br>
On day two of my certificate course i got reintroduced to different coding fundamentals such as, Basic statements and expressions, variables and data, int/str, conditions and making/ calling funtions. This course started out being very easy, but in the end was a little more challenging. The course consited of both theory and practice (exercises). The exercises was available for download on the course site. 
The presenter of the course today was also, Annyce Davis, and the name of the course was: Programming Foundations: Fundamentals.

![course 2](https://github.com/jona937d/4_semester_jona21m9/assets/92019351/50d3bd99-907d-419a-a263-cd81356457d9)

unlike yesterday, there where no "verification" or exam for finishing the course.

Exercise 1: playing with if/else statements

<img width="380" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-27 113303" src="https://github.com/jona937d/4_semester_jona21m9/assets/92019351/0534a2c7-ffbe-48d1-b99a-3df29efd09fe">

Exercise 2: In this exercise i wanted to make it a bit more complicated. In the original, any answear other than "yes" would result in the answer "Oh no! That makes me sad!". so i "stored" different answers in lists and added an option for the program, if none of the "elements" where typed ("thats not an answer").

Exercise 3: In this exercise i had to make a funtion and call it 3 different times. my solution compared to the one from the course what a bit more complicated, but it worked.
