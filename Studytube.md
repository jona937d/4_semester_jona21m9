Today i spend time making the weekplan, i choose to make it in Github and will somehow integrate it in Powerpages this friday. I researched for different Linkedin certificates, that is relevant for this semester. I ended up finding one callled "Career Essentials in Software Development by Microsoft and LinkedIn" (link in the Reference dropdown). The certificate consists of three different courses (see picture in the dropdown menu)

Today was the first day of the course-learning and the topic was: Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development and was presented by Annyce Davis.

The course contained the basic idea of being a software developer, different roles, programming languages and also some hands-on coding examples. I ended the course by doing an exam, that i will show in the picture dropdown. There will also be code snippets of the exercises. I think the course was a little easy, but i still think it benefitted me and freshened up my coding skills.

<summary> Describtion</summary>
<br>
On day two of my certificate course i got reintroduced to different coding fundamentals such as, Basic statements and expressions, variables and data, int/str, conditions and making/ calling funtions. This course started out being very easy, but in the end was a little more challenging. The course consited of both theory and practice (exercises). The exercises was available for download on the course site. 
The presenter of the course today was also, Annyce Davis, and the name of the course was: Programming Foundations: Fundamentals.

![course 2](https://github.com/jona937d/4_semester_jona21m9/assets/92019351/50d3bd99-907d-419a-a263-cd81356457d9)

unlike yesterday, there where no "verification" or exam for finishing the course.

Exercise 1: playing with if/else statements

<img width="380" alt="Skærmbillede 2023-09-27 113303" src="https://github.com/jona937d/4_semester_jona21m9/assets/92019351/0534a2c7-ffbe-48d1-b99a-3df29efd09fe">

Exercise 2: In this exercise i wanted to make it a bit more complicated. In the original, any answear other than "yes" would result in the answer "Oh no! That makes me sad!". so i "stored" different answers in lists and added an option for the program, if none of the "elements" where typed ("thats not an answer").

Exercise 3: In this exercise i had to make a funtion and call it 3 different times. my solution compared to the one from the course what a bit more complicated, but it worked.

The course on day 3 was presented by no other than Principal Technical Course Developer at DocuSign, Sasha Vodnik. The main topic of the course was: Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamental.

![course 3](https://github.com/jona937d/4_semester_jona21m9/assets/92019351/f9615235-108c-4c8d-8563-3a9c04f3affe)

The difficulty of this course was a bit higher, but i was able to mangage and understand the content. The methods and theory i got introduced to in this course was a level up from the 2 previous courses, but many of the fundamentals was still beneficial in doing the attached exercises. Some of the topics from this course was: constructing and using collections, iterations and loops, using external codes (functions), working with and manipulating strings, debugging and object oriented content. The conetent was fairly rasy to understand, partly because of Sasha's way to descibe the theory using everyday no-code visual examples.

<summary> Describtion</summary>
<br>
Today i attended the final Exam of the course. Sadly i ended up failing the test twice, scoring the highest of 60%. The test felt marginally harder than the small ones throughout the course. Some of the questions was examples of code with errors that i had to pick out. Other questions where examples of code where i had to figure out the output. There was also questions regarding other programming languages, such as Ruby, Java, JS, Ruby and C++, which i found very difficult to answer.

<summary> Reflections</summary>
<br>
Overall it has been a really educative and learningful course and i finally got myself to code a bit. Most of the fundamentals i already knew, but it was nice to freshen up old knowledge by practacing. It was very upsetting failing the test twice and this weeks work kind of felt like a failure in that regard. I think i would be able to pass the exam by practacing both python and learn the fundamentals of other programming languages.

# Weekplan

Regarding the Weekplan i finished what i had to do the days that i planned doing them. There where only some insignificant changes to the daily time-stamps.
